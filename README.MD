Chapter 10 - React-Bootstrap


react bootstrap and react - router bootstrap

-panel
-nav
-modal
-form
-button
-table
-row
-col

NOTE: a bug on modal nested in navitem. 
there is an onClick event defined in navitem to show modal; then on the cancel button in modal, another onclick event to close modal. however: if you click anywhere in the modal, the onclick event (showmodal) in the navitem will be triggerd. 

neet to somehow fix this in the future.
