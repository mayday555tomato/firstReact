Chapter 08 - Programmatic Navigation FINAL

refresh page works
unified headers
Hot Module Replacement: have to run two windows:
- Express server 
- webpack-dev-server

in webpack-dev-server page, updates will show up in the webpage. it will refresh automatically.

I did not do HotModuleReplacement with Middleware which is to having only one window with one server. 
TODO: find a way to do it maybe? but right now it is good enough for me.
